Spring-boot demo

For now, just the beginning of a simple spring-boot project using mysql.

Once you start it in STS as a spring boot application, you can run http://localhost:8090/cars.

You must have mysql community server installed and create a schema for cars with a user of cars with a password of cars.

Make sure that you have -Dserver.port=8090 in your run configuration for spring boot in the Arguments tab.
